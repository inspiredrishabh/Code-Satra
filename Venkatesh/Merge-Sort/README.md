## Merge Sort

Since we know that the first n elements are sorted and the remaining m are unsorted, we first split the array into 2 parts, a sorted part and an unsorted part.

Next we perform merge sort on the unsorted part.

After both our parts are sorted, we merge them to obtain the final sorted array.
